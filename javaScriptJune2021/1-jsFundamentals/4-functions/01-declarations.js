/**
 * FUNCTIONS
 *
 * Functions do:
 *
 * 1. take input (argument) which the function will handle/process;
 * 2. they process the input given to them;
 * 3. they usually, but not always, return some value;
 * 4. they can be invoked (called) as many times as we want to reduce code repetition
 *
 * When a function doesn't return anything, it's called a 'SIDE EFFECT'
